      <p>Students learn the full video production life cycle, from planning and pre-production, to editing and post-production. Video and audio technology tools are introduced, building on the techniques and best practices developed through DSLR photography. Students practice working through pre-production and production of both video and audio, ensuring the best quality result when transitioning to post-production to limit the amount of correcting needed during the editing process. Pre-production methods are taught to students so they are better equipt for the production process. For example, they are expected to make storyboards before filming. Students also learn the proper use of equipment such as: lighting, cameras, microphones, etc. They are also taught the many options available to them for each item. </p>
